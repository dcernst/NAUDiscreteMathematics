  <title>Sets and Counting Principles</title>
  <p>
    A <term>set</term> is a collection of objects called <term>elements</term>.
    Typically, braces are used to denote sets as in <m>\{b,c,d,f\}</m>,
    which is the same set as <m>\{b,d,c,f\}</m>,
    and the same as <m>\{c,f,c,f,d,b\}</m>.
    If <m>A</m> is a set and <m>x</m> is an element of <m>A</m>,
    we write <m>{x\in A}</m>.
    Otherwise, we write <m>{x\notin A}</m>.
    For example,
    <m>b\in \{b,d,c,f\}</m> while <m>e\notin \{b,d,c,f\}</m>.
    The set containing no elements is called the <term>empty set</term>,
    and is denoted by the symbol <m>{\emptyset}</m>,
    but can also be written as <m>{\{\}}</m>.
    Any set that contains at least one element is referred to as a
    <term>nonempty set</term>.
    If we think of a set as a box potentially containing some stuff,
    then the empty set is a box with nothing in it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The empty set and the set <m>\{b,c,d,f\}</m> are examples of <term>finite sets</term>.
    Any set that is not finite is an
    <term>infinite set</term>.
    For example, the <term>natural numbers</term>
    defined by <m>{\mathbb{N}\:= \{1,2,3,\ldots\}}</m> and <term>integers</term>
    defined by <m>{\mathbb{Z}\:= \{0, \pm 1, \pm2, \pm 3, \ldots\}}</m> are both examples of infinite sets.
    Some books will include zero in the set of natural numbers,
    but we do not.
    Since the set of natural numbers consists of the positive integers,
    the natural numbers are sometimes denoted by <m>{\mathbb{Z}^+}</m>.
    The <term>real numbers</term>,
    denoted by <m>{\mathbb{R}}</m>,
    is another example of an infinite set.
    If you look closely at our definitions for the natural numbers and integers you will notice that we wrote <m>{\:=}</m> instead of <m>=</m>.
    We use <m>\:=</m> to mean that the symbol or expression on the left is defined to be equal to the expression on the right.
  </p>
  <p>
    The language associated to sets is specific.
    We will often define sets using the following notation,
    called <term>set-builder notation</term>:
    <me>
      {S=\{x \in A\mid P(x)\}}
    </me>,
    where <m>P(x)</m> is some predicate statement involving <m>x</m>.
    The first part
    <q><m>x \in A</m></q>
    denotes what type of <m>x</m> is being considered.
    The predicate to the right of the vertical bar determines the condition(s) that each <m>x</m> must satisfy in order to be a member of the set.
    This notation is read as
    <q>The set of all <m>x</m> in <m>A</m> such that <m>P(x)</m>.</q>
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The set <m>\{x\in \mathbb{N}\mid x \mbox{ is even and } x\geq 8\}</m> describes the collection of even natural numbers that are greater than or equal to 8.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We can define the <term>rational numbers</term>
        using set-builder notation via
        <me>
          {\mathbb{Q}\:= \{a/b \mid a, b \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ and }  b \neq 0\}}
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Write the set of perfect squares
        <m>\{1,4,9,16,\ldots\}</m> using set-builder notation.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </problem>
  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Translate the following set defined with set-builder notation in English and list a few of its elements:
        <me>
          P=\{x\in\mathbb{N} \mid x=2^n\mbox{ for some } n\in\mathbb{N}\}
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </problem>
  <p>
    The <term>cardinality</term> of a set <m>A</m>,
    denoted by <m>{|A|}</m>, is the number of elements in <m>A</m>.
    For example, if <m>A = \{b,c,d,f\}</m>, then <m>|A| = 4</m>.
    We will mostly concern ourselves with the cardinality of finite sets in this book.
    Cardinality gets wildly more complicated if we consider infinite sets.
  </p>
  <p>
    If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are sets,
    then we say that <m>A</m> is a <term>subset</term> of <m>B</m>,
    written <m>{A\subseteq B}</m>,
    provided that every element of <m>A</m> is an element of <m>B</m>.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We have <m>\{c,f,g\} \subseteq \{b,c,d,f,g\}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>

        Determine whether each of the following statements is true or false.
        If a statement is true, explain why.
        If a statement is false, provide a specific counterexample.
        <ol>

  <theorem>
    <title>Transitivity of Subsets</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> are sets.
        If <m>A\subseteq B</m> and
        <m>B\subseteq C</m>, then <m>A\subseteq C</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    Note that two sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <term>equal</term>,
    denoted <m>{A=B}</m>, if the sets contain the same elements.
    It's clear that <m>A=B</m> if and only if
    <m>A \subseteq B</m> and <m>B \subseteq A</m>.
    If <m>A\subseteq B</m>, then <m>A</m> is called a
    <term>proper subset</term>
    provided that <m>A\neq B</m>.
    In this case, we may write
    <m>{A\subset B}</m> or <m>{A\subsetneq B}</m>.
    Some authors use <m>\subset</m> to mean <m>\subseteq</m>,
    so some confusion could arise if you are not reading carefully.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sometimes it is useful to fix a set to focus our attention on.
    The term <term>universe of discourse</term>
    (or <term>domain of discourse</term>)
    generally refers to the collection of objects being discussed in a specific context.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be sets in some universe of discourse <m>U</m>.
    We define the following.
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <term>union</term> of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is <m>{A \cup B \:= \{x\in U \mid x\in A \mbox{ or } x\in B \}}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <term>intersection</term> of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is <m>{A \cap B \:=\{x\in U \mid x\in A \mbox{ and } x\in B \}}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have the property that <m>A \cap B = \emptyset</m>,
          then we say that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <term>disjoint</term>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <term>set difference</term>
          (relative to <m>U</m>)
          of the sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is <m>{A \setminus B \:=\{x\in U \mid x\in A \mbox{ and } x\notin B \}}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <term>complement</term>
          (relative to <m>U</m>)
          of <m>A</m> is the set <m>{A^c\:= U \setminus A =\{x \in U \mid x \notin A\}}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

        <m>B=\{1, 3, 5\}</m>, and <m>C=\{2, 4, 6, 8\}</m>.
        Find each of the following and then determine the cardinality of the set.
        <ol>

    A <term>string</term> of objects of <term>length</term>

        <m>c</m>, <m>d</m>, and <m>f</m>.
        Another way to see this is to note that there are 4 choices for the first (left-hand) letter and for each of these there are 4 choices for the right-hand letter,
        so there are <m>4 \cdot 4 = 16</m> words total.

    We have been dancing around a fundamental counting principle.
    Let's state it officially.
    There are three progressively more general versions,
    the first of which we already encountered in <xref ref="prob_cardinality_of_product">Problem</xref>.
    The second version officially follows from the first version by induction,
    which is a topic we will encounter later.
    The third version follows from the second by making a careful use of notation to identify the set
    <m>\mathcal{O}</m> with a Cartesian product.

    The next principle, called the <term>Division Principle</term>,
    provides a method for ignoring
    <q>unimportant</q>
    differences when counting things.
    Loosely speaking,
    the general idea is count a larger set of distinct objects and then use the Division Principle to
    <q>merge</q>
    the ones that are not significantly different from each other.
    As a motivating example,
    suppose my kids have 30 toys scattered around the room.
    After asking my kids to pick up all the toys and put each toy in a bin according to what type of toy it is (e.g., Transformer),
    there ends up being 6 toys in each bin.
    In this case,
    it is easy to see that there must be 5 distinct bins.

        Does it matter if the pieces of candy are identical or not?
        If so, count both situations.
