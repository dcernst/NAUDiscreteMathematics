  <title>Introduction to Graph Theory</title>
  <p>
    Loosely speaking,
    a graph is a collection of points called vertices and connecting segments called edges,
    each of which starts at a vertex,
    ends at a vertex and contains no other vertices beside these.
    More formally, we define the term as follows.
    A <term>graph</term> consists of two sets,
    a nonempty set <m>V</m> of points called <term>vertices</term>
    and a set <m>E</m> whose elements,
    called <term>edges</term>, are multisets of size two from <m>V</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each edge is associated with either one vertex which serves as both endpoints or two vertices as its endpoints.
    Technically, each edge is a multiset of the form
    <m>{\multiset{u,v}}</m> where <m>u,v\in V</m>.
    We say that <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are <term>endpoints</term>
    of the edge <m>\multiset{u,v}</m>.
    In an abuse of notation,
    it is customary to write <m>{\{u,v\}}</m> even if <m>u=v</m>.
    In fact, we may abbreviate further and denote the edge by <m>{uv}</m>.
    Note that the order in which the vertices of an edge are listed is irrelevant.
    That is, <m>\multiset{u,v}=\multiset{v,u}</m>,
    <m>\{u,v\}=\{v,u\}</m>, and <m>uv=vu</m>.
    If <m>G</m> is the graph associated with the vertex set <m>V</m> and edge set <m>E</m>,
    we write <m>{G=(V,E)}</m>.
    It is worth pointing out that we assumed that <m>V</m> is nonempty,
    but <m>E</m> is allowed to be empty (i.e., the graph has no edges).
  </p>
  <p>
    It is customary to represent a graph using visual representations,
    where each vertex is a dot and each edge is a connecting segment,
    not necessarily straight.
  </p>
  <example xml:id="ex_graph">

        Here is an example of a graph with vertex set <m>V=\{v_1, v_2, v_3,v_4,v_5\}</m>.

    There is a lot of terminology associated to graphs!
    Here are some of the relevant concepts.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Vertices <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> of a graph are <term>adjacent</term>
          if they are the endpoints of the same edge.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>v</m> is an endpoint of the edge <m>e</m>,
          we say that <m>e</m> is <term>incident</term> to <m>v</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If an edge <m>e</m> is incident to vertices <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>,
          we say that <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are
          <term>connected</term> by edge <m>e</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          An edge <m>e</m> that is incident to a single vertex (i.e., <m>e=uu</m> for some <m>u\in V</m>) is called a <term>loop</term>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <term>order</term> of a graph is the number of vertices in the graph.
          That is, if <m>G=(V,E)</m>, then the order of <m>G</m> is <m>|V|</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <term>degree</term> of a vertex <m>v</m>, written <m>\deg(v)</m>,
          is the number of edges incident to <m>v</m> (i.e., the number of edges that have <m>v</m> as an endpoint).
          Note that a loop contributes 2 to a vertex's degree,
          one for each of the two ends of the edge.
          The degree of a vertex <m>v</m> is denoted <m>{\deg(v)}</m>.

    Many graphs have similar properties that allow us to categorize them.
    Here are several families of graphs.
    <ul>

        <p>
          <em>Complete Graphs</em>.
          The <term>complete graph</term> on <m>n\geq 1</m> vertices,
          denoted <m>{K_n}</m>,
          is the graph of order <m>n</m> such that each pair of vertices is connected by exactly one edge,
          and there are no other edges (i.e., no loops).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Cycle Graphs</em>.
          The <term>cycle graph</term> on <m>n\ge 3</m> vertices,
          denoted <m>{C_n}</m>,
          is the graph such that when the <m>n</m> vertices are suitably labeled <m>v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n</m>,
          the edges of <m>C_n</m> are <m>\{v_1,v_2\}, \{v_2,v_3\}, \dots, \{v_{n-1},v_n\}, \{v_n,v_1\}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Path Graphs</em>.
          The <term>path</term> on <m>n\geq 1</m> vertices,
          denoted <m>{P_n}</m>, has a description similar to <m>C_n</m>:
          for distinct vertices suitably labeled <m>v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n</m>,
          the edges of <m>P_n</m> are <m>\{v_1,v_2\}, \{v_2,v_3\}, \dots, \{v_{n-1},v_n\}</m>.

      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Wheel Graphs</em>.
          The <term>wheel graph</term> on <m>n \ge 4</m> vertices,
          denoted <m>{W_n}</m>,
          is the graph <m>C_{n-1}</m> together with one additional vertex that is connected to each of the vertices of <m>C_{n-1}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Hypercube Graphs</em>.
          The <term>hypercube</term> of dimension <m>n\geq 1</m>,
          denoted <m>{Q_n}</m>,
          is the graph whose vertices are labeled with the <m>2^n</m> bit strings of length <m>n</m> with an edge connecting two vertices if and only if their labels differ in exactly one bit.

  <p>
    One consequence of the previous theorem is that any sequence with an odd sum (e.g., 331) is not graphic.
    It turns out that if a sequence has an even sum,
    it is the degree sequence of a multigraph.
    The construction of such a graph is straightforward:
    connect vertices with odd degrees in pairs,
    and fill out the remaining even degree counts by self-loops.
    The question of whether a given degree sequence can be realized by a simple graph is more challenging.
    This problem is also called <term>graph realization problem</term>
    and can be solved by either the Erd&#xf6;s<ndash/>Gallai theorem or the Havel<ndash/>Hakimi algorithm.
    Unfortunately, this is beyond the scope of this course.

    We will now focus on making new graphs from old.

    If <m>G=(V,E)</m> is a graph and <m>S\subseteq V</m>,
    the <term>neighborhood</term> of <m>S</m>,
    denoted <m>{N(S)}</m> is the set of all vertices in <m>V</m> adjacent to at least one member of <m>S</m>.
    Of course, we can consider the neighborhood of a single vertex <m>v</m>,
    which is denoted <m>{N(v)}</m>.
    A neighborhood of a single vertex does not include itself,
    and is more specifically the <term>open neighborhood</term> of <m>v</m>.
    It is also possible to define a neighborhood in which <m>v</m> itself is also included.
    This is called the <term>closed neighborhood</term> of <m>v</m>,
    sometimes denoted by <m>{N[v]}</m>.
    Unless stated otherwise, a neighborhood is assumed to be open.

    A <term>matching</term>
    (or <term>independent edge set</term>)
    in a graph <m>G=(V,E)</m> is a subset of edges
    <m>M\subseteq E</m> without common vertices.
    That is, a subset of the edges is a matching if each vertex appears as an endpoint in at most one edge of that matching.
    If <m>M</m> is a matching,
    a vertex is said to be <term>matched</term>
    if it is an endpoint of one of the edges in <m>M</m>.
    Otherwise, the vertex is called <term>unmatched</term>.
    We say that <m>M</m> <term>covers</term>
    a subset <m>S\subseteq V</m> if every vertex of <m>S</m> is matched by <m>M</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We now explore a type of matching problem.
    Suppose we have a bipartite graph <m>G=(V,E)</m> with a bipartition <m>(V_1,V_2)</m>.
    We want to match up each element
    <m>v_1\in V_1</m> with exactly one element
    <m>v_2 \in V_2</m> that is adjacent to it in <m>G</m> and that is not matched to any other element of <m>V_1</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A <term>total matching</term> from <m>V_1</m> to <m>V_2</m> is matching that covers <m>V_1</m>.
    In other words, for each <m>v_1\in V_1</m>,
    there is a unique edge <m>m\in M</m> and a unique
    <m>v_2\in V_2</m> such that <m>m</m> is incident to <m>v_1</m> and <m>v_2</m>.
    We can think of <m>M</m> as specifying an injective function from <m>V_1</m> to <m>V_2</m>.
    If every vertex in <m>V_2</m> is also matched (i.e., <m>V_2</m> is covered),
    then the matching is called a <term>perfect matching</term>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finding a matching in a bipartite graph can be treated as a network flow problem.
  </p>
  <problem>
    <statement>

        If so, find one.

    In order for there to be a total matching from <m>V_1</m> to <m>V_2</m>,
    we need <m>\deg(v_1)>0</m> for each <m>v_1\in V_1</m>.
    However, that is not enough.
    <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Hall">Phillip Hall</url>
    (1904<ndash/>1982) discovered the following condition,
    known as <term>Hall's Marriage Theorem</term>,
    needed for a total matching.

  <theorem>
    <title>Hall's Marriage Theorem</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A bipartite graph with bipartition
        <m>(V_1,V_2)</m> has a total matching from <m>V_1</m> to <m>V_2</m> if and only if
        <m>|N(S)| \ge |S|</m> for all subsets <m>S\subseteq V_1</m>.
        In other words,
        every subset <m>S</m> of <m>V_1</m> must have sufficiently many neighbors in <m>V_2</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    Hall actually stated and proved a more general theorem,
    but we have given its formulation in the context of graph theory.
  </p>
  <p>
    A graph <m>G=(V,E)</m> is called
    <term><m>k</m>-regular</term>
    if <m>\deg(v)=k</m> for every <m>v\in V</m>.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The cycle graph <m>C_n</m> is 2-regular,
        the complete graph <m>K_n</m> is <m>(n-1)</m>-regular,
        the hypercube graph <m>Q_n</m> is <m>n</m>-regular,
        and the complete bipartite graph <m>K_{n,n}</m> is <m>n</m>-regular.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

    <statement>
      <p>
        Prove that if <m>G</m> is a <m>k</m>-regular bipartite graph with bipartition
