  <title>Pigeonhole Principle</title>
  <p>
    The <term>Pigeonhole Principle</term> is a very natural idea.
    It says: If a collection of at least <m>n+1</m> objects is put into <m>n</m> boxes,
    then there is a box with at least two things in it.
    The Pigeonhole Principle has surprisingly deep applications.
    We will start with a few examples.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Back in <xref ref="prob_injective_surjective_cardinality">Problem</xref>,
        we implicitly used the Pigeonhole Principle when we argued that if
        <m>f:A\to B</m> is a function for finite sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, then
        <ol marker="alpha">
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>f</m> is an injection, then <m>|A|\leq |B|</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>f</m> is a surjection, then <m>|A|\geq |B|</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <problem xml:id="prob_colored_balls_in_box">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A box has blue, green, yellow,
        red, orange, and white balls.
        How many must be drawn without looking to be sure of getting at least two of the same color?
      </p>

  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Prove that if seven distinct numbers are selected from <m>\{1, 2, \ldots, 11\}</m>,
        then there exists a pair of numbers that sum to 12.

    We would like to generalize the Pigeonhole Principle,
    but first we need a useful function.
    The <term>ceiling function</term>
    of a real number <m>x</m>,
    written <m>{\lceil x \rceil}</m>,
    is the smallest integer greater than or equal to <m>x</m>.
    That is, <m>\lceil x \rceil</m> is an integer,
    <m>\lceil x \rceil \geq x</m>,
    and there is no other integer between <m>\lceil x \rceil</m> and <m>x</m>.
    You can think of it as the
    <q>round-up to an integer</q>
    function.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For example, <m>\lceil \pi \rceil = 4</m>,
        <m>\lceil -\pi \rceil = -3</m>,
        and <m>\lceil 7 \rceil = 7</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    We can now generalize the Pigeonhole Principle as follows.

    <title>Generalized Pigeonhole Principle</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>n</m> objects are placed in <m>m</m> boxes,
        then there is a box with at least <m>\lceil \frac{n}{m} \rceil</m> objects.

    <statement>
      <p>
        If 20 buses seating at most 50 carry 621 passengers to a ball game,
        then some bus must have at least
        <em><nbsp/> <nbsp/> <nbsp/> <nbsp/> <nbsp/> <nbsp/> <nbsp/> <nbsp/></em><nbsp/>passengers.
      </p>

        How many balls must be drawn from the box in <xref ref="prob_colored_balls_in_box">Problem</xref>

  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m> and let <m>S=\{1,2,\ldots,2n\}</m>.
        Argue that if we choose <m>n+1</m> distinct elements from the set <m>S</m>,
        then among those elements there must exist a pair of numbers such that one is a multiple of the other.
        <em>Hint:</em> Every number in <m>S</m> is of the form <m>2^km</m>,
        where <m>k</m> is a nonnegative integer and <m>m</m> is odd.

        Explain why every collection of ten distinct integers
        <m>x_1, x_2, \dots,
