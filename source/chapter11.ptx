    A <term>digraph</term>
    (or <term>directed graph</term>)
    <m>D</m> consists of a set <m>V</m> of vertices and a set <m>E</m> of
    <term>directed edges</term>
    (or <term>arrows</term>),
    each of which is represented as an ordered pair <m>(u,v)</m>,
    where <m>u,v\in V</m>.
    We say that <m>u</m> is the <term>initial vertex</term>
    and <m>v</m> is the <term>terminal vertex</term>
    of the directed edge <m>(u,v)</m>.
    We write <m>D=(V,E)</m> as we did with undirected graphs.
    The <term>indegree</term> of a vertex <m>v</m> in a digraph,
    denoted <m>{\deg^-(v)}</m>,
    is the number of directed edges that have <m>v</m> as a terminal vertex while the
    <term>outdegree</term> of <m>v</m>,
    denoted <m>{\deg^+(v)}</m>,
    is the number of edges having <m>v</m> as an initial vertex.
  </p>
  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Find the indegree and outdegree of each vertex in the following graph.

    As expected,
    we have the following result that is analogous to the Handshake Lemma
    (<xref ref="thm_Handshake">Theorem</xref>).

  <theorem>

      <p>
        If <m>D = (V,E)</m> is a digraph, then
        <me>

    Each graph/digraph is determined by its vertices and the manner in which they are connected by edges,
    not the way a graph/digraph might be sketched.
    We can represent a graph in a couple of ways.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <term>adjacency list</term> of a simple graph lists all vertices in one column and all adjacent vertices in second column.
    For a digraph,
    the columns contain the initial vertices and the associated terminal vertices.

  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Make up a couple examples to explore adjacency lists for simple graphs and digraphs.

    An <m>m\times n</m> <term>matrix</term>
    <m>A</m> is a rectangular array of numbers with <m>m</m> rows and <m>n</m> columns.
    The entry in the <m>i</m>th row and <m>j</m>th column is indicated by <m>A_{i,j}</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        What will the adjacency matrix for <m>P_n</m> look like,
        assuming the vertices are taken in the natural order (start at one end of the path and end at the other)?
        What about <m>C_n</m>?
        <m>K_n</m>?
      </p>
    </statement>
  </problem>
  <p>
    Recall that a graph is not determined by a sketch since many sketches give the same graph.
    It may be hard to recognize from sketches whether two graphs are
    <q>essentially</q>
    the same even though the vertices may be different points.
    The notion of isomorphism
    (same form)
    gives us a way to deal with this.
    Two <em>simple</em> graphs <m>G_1 = (V_1, E_1)</m> and
    <m>G_2 = (V_2, E_2)</m> are the <term>isomorphic</term>,
    written <m>G_1 \cong G_2</m>,
    if there is a a bijection <m>f:V_1\to V_2</m> such that <m>\{u,v\}</m> is an edge in <m>G_1</m> if and only if
    <m>\{f(u),f(v)\}</m> is an edge in <m>G_2</m>.
    The function <m>f</m> is called an <term>isomorphism</term>.
    For digraphs,
    we require that <m>(u,v)</m> is a directed edge in <m>G_1</m> if and only if
    <m>(f(u),f(v))</m> is a directed edge in <m>G_2</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For <m>G_1=(V_1,E_1)</m> and <m>G_2=(V_2,E_2)</m>,
    to show that <m>G_1\cong G_2</m>:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        State a vertex matching explicitly, and
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Either
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Check adjacency for each pair of vertices in <m>G_1</m> and the corresponding pair in <m>G_2</m> (a total of <m>\binom{|V_1|}{2}</m> checks).
            This could also be as simple as providing sketches for each graph that clearly exhibit the correspondence of vertices and edges.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Demonstrate that the adjacency matrices of <m>G_1</m> and <m>G_2</m> are the same using an ordering that is compatible with the vertex matching.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <em>Warning!</em> The second method above usually involves much less writing,
    but be aware that the adjacency matrices may differ in one ordering but agree with a different ordering.
  </p>
  <p>
    The simplest way to show that
    <m>G_1 \not\cong G_2</m> is to show that a feature preserved under isomorphism
    (called an <term>invariant</term>)
    holds for one graph but not the other.
    Here are a few isomorphic invariants:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Order of the graph
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Number of edges in the graph
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Number of vertices of a given degree
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Degree sequence
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Vertices of degree <m>k</m> and <m>\ell</m> are adjacent
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Subgraph that is isomorphic to <m>C_n</m> or <m>P_n</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Determine whether the following graphs are isomorphic.

    The following theorem likely does not come as a surprise.

  <theorem>

        A graph <m>G</m> is connected if and only if for each pair of distinct vertices <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>,

    A digraph is <term>strongly connected</term>
    if for each pair of distinct vertices <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> there is a (directed) walk from <m>u</m> to <m>v</m>.
    A digraph is <term>weakly connected</term>
    if the underlying undirected graph in which the direction of edges is removed is connected.
    Note that a strongly connected digraph will always be weakly connected.
    A <term>strongly connected component</term>
    of a digraph is a maximal strongly connected subgraph.
  </p>
  <p>
    We now introduce a couple of important circuits that a graph may or may not possess.
    An <term>Euler circuit</term> in a graph <m>G</m> is a circuit that contains every edge of the graph.
    An <term>Euler trail</term> in a graph is a trail that contains every edge of the graph.
    Note that an Euler circuit is also an Euler trail as well.
  </p>
  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Determine whether each of the following graphs has an Euler trail.
        How about an Euler circuit?

    Unfortunately, unlike the situation for Euler circuits,

    but these do not cover all possibilities.

  <p>
    In fact, we have the following theorem.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A simple graph <m>G</m> is connected if and only if it contains a spanning tree.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    Below, we provide informal descriptions of the depth-first and breadth-first algorithms for identifying a spanning tree in a connected simple graph <m>G</m> with vertices ordered as <m>v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <term>Depth-First Search.</term> Initialize:
    <m>T = \{v_1\}</m>, <m>v = v_1</m>.
    As long as <m>T</m> does not contain all vertices, do the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Choose the first vertex <m>w</m> in the ordered list that is adjacent to <m>v</m> and is not yet in <m>T</m>.
          If there are no vertices adjacent to <m>v</m> that are not yet in <m>T</m>,
          return to the most recently added previous vertex <m>u</m> and let <m>v = u</m> and repeat this step with the revised <m>v</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add <m>w</m> and edge <m>\{v,w\}</m> to <m>T</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Set <m>v = w</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Repeat the steps above
    (with revised <m>v</m>'s)
    as often as needed.
  </p>
  <p>
    <term>Breadth-First Search.</term> Initialize:
    <m>T = \{v_1\}</m>, <m>L = v_1</m>.
    As long as <m>T</m> does not contain all vertices, do the following.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Put <m>v =</m> the first vertex in <m>L</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Remove that vertex from <m>L</m>.
        (On paper, just mark out.)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        For all vertices adjacent to <m>v</m> not yet in <m>T</m>,
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>w</m> is the first vertex in order that is adjacent to <m>v</m> and not yet in <m>T</m>,
            add <m>w</m> and edge <m>\{v,w\}</m> to <m>T</m> and put <m>w</m> at the end of list <m>L</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Repeat until all vertices adjacent to <m>v</m> not yet in <m>T</m> have been examined.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Repeat the above steps as needed.

    A <term>weighted graph</term> is a graph with a positive numerical values assigned to each edge of the graph.
    A <term>minimal spanning tree</term>
    of a connected weighted graph is a spanning tree that has the smallest possible sum of weights for its edges.
  </p>
  <p>
    Minimal spanning trees arose in the practical matter of designing an efficient electrical network,
    and the concept applies to similar network notions in many areas such as transportation,
    utilities,
    and others.
    We will discuss one early, elementary,
    and effective algorithms for finding a minimal spanning tree in a connected undirected weighted graph.
  </p>
  <p>
    <term>Prim's Algorithm</term> (Jarnik 1930, Prim 1957).
    Assume <m>G</m> is a connected,
    undirected, weighted loopless graph of order <m>n</m>.
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Initialize a tree with a single vertex,
          chosen arbitrarily from the graph.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Grow the tree by one edge: Of the edges that connect the tree to vertices not yet in the tree,
          find a minimum-weight edge, and transfer it to the tree.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Repeat step 2
          (until all vertices are in the tree).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    Prim's Algorithm is an example of a greedy algorithm.
